You have lived your life in grace and dignity, and never was it more evident than during the events of 1984 when you resigned,” Sam Haskell told Williams on stage during the live show. “Though none of us currently in the organization were involved then, on behalf of today’s organization, I want to apologize to you and to your mother, Miss Helen Williams.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He continued: “I want to apologize for anything that was said or done that made you feel any less than the Miss America you are and the Miss America you always will be.”</p><p>Williams was dethroned 10 months after winning the coveted crown at the time. On Monday, she accepted the apology, stating that it was “so unexpected but so beautiful.”</p><p>After the scandal, Williams went on to have a highly successful career. Some of her acting credits include Desperate Housewives, Ugly Betty, and 666 Park Avenue.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKSiq6Nirq6x0aKammWnnbxuvsSpo5qblZl6t63NnqqsmV2stq24yJqkrGWRpbytu8ayZLCZo2KzsL6Mq5itoZ6cwG5%2Bj2psamxp</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
