The total value of the <a href=# rel=noopener>surpassed</a> Gerrit Cole's $324 million pact with the New York Yankees as the richest for a pitcher.</p><p>As for what the Dodgers are likely getting for their money, one scout told ESPN's <a href=# rel=noopener>Kiley McDaniel</a> that Yamamoto "should be a top pitcher in the sport" when he goes through an adjustment period against MLB hitters.</p><p>Yamamoto's three spring-training starts have shown the strong potential he possesses, but also some areas where he might struggle initially adapting. His 14 strikeouts in 9.2 innings are very encouraging.</p><p>In his most recent spring start on March 13, Yamamoto struck out the first three Seattle Mariners' hitters he faced in the first inning. Each of those at-bats ended with a different pitch. He got J.P. Crawford looking at a fastball, Julio Rodriguez swinging at a curveball and Jorge Polanco swinging over the top of a splitter.</p>MLB <span class=acct>@MLB</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Yoshinobu Yamamoto strikes out the side in the 1st! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SpringTraining?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SpringTraining&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/OKrpO24LeU">pic.twitter.com/OKrpO24LeU&lt;/a></p><p>In that same start, though, the Mariners figured Yamamoto out. He finished the game allowing four earned runs on eight hits in 4.2 innings. The right-hander's previous start against the Chicago White Sox saw him give up five earned runs on six hits in three innings.</p><p>Bad spring training starts don't necessarily mean anything. We don't exactly what Yamamoto might be working on going into the season.</p><p>One thing McDaniel noticed from Yamamoto's spring starts that might be a concern was his fastball "played below its grade" and 13 of the 16 hard-hit balls he allowed were on the heater:</p><p><i>"In his last Cactus League outing, the Seattle Mariners were clearly aware of his tendency to lead with the fastball: The second time through the lineup, the top six hitters in the lineup basically ambushed first pitch strikes and/or the first fastball he threw in the zone, producing four hits and a deep flyout."</i></p><p>Yamamoto, along with Dodgers catchers, will have to work on pitch-sequencing so hitters know they can't sit on his fastball on the first or second pitch of every at-bat. But his off-speed stuff, which the Mariners couldn't touch in the first inning, is very good.</p><p>In particular, Yamamoto's splitter and cutter will probably be his out-pitches. McDaniel noted 18 of the 20 cutters that Yamamoto threw in spring training produced weak contact. His splitter is a potentially elite pitch.</p><p>Per The Athletic's <a href=# rel=noopener>Eno Sarris</a>, Yamamoto's splitter rated as a 155 on the Stuff+ metric during the 2023 World Baseball Classic. Stuff+ uses the movement profile of a pitch to estimate how deceptive it is.</p><p>Yamamoto's splitter from the 2023 WBC would have rated ahead of Felix Bautista of the Baltimore Orioles and Jhoan Duran of the Minesota Twins (both <a href=# rel=noopener>tied</a> at 149) as the best in MLB last season.</p><p>The 25-year-old will make his MLB regular-season debut on Thursday when the Dodgers take on the San Diego Padres in South Korea.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWiEdHyMpqObZaOYvLbAjJ2mnZ%2BVp8Buxc6sn6Kmn5fCbsXAppimp6SkerS0zq6jnWWSmnqiedOop2aomamwqbHRZpifrJWneqKwya6qraWVo8G0</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
