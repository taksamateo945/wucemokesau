They’re gonna ask me one question, ‘Did you fix the problem?’ That is all I’m focusing on.”</p><p>The comments came in response to the termination of Deputy Commissioner for Intelligence and Investigation Sarena Townsend, who has been lauded for her progress on the internal use-of-force case under the federal monitor.</p><p>Townsend, whose firing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">was first reported by The City</a>, processed nearly 10,000 backlogged use-of-force cases over her three-year tenure — but had been with odds with the Correction Officers’ Benevolent Association.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/adams-defends-firing-index.jpg><p>The firing followed newly Department of Correction Commissioner Louis Molina’s rollback of a <a href=#>strict sick leave policy</a> that was implemented to stop corrections officers from calling out when not sick —&nbsp;a widespread issue that contributed to a staffing crisis.</p><p>Adams defended the changes, which were a series of easy victories handed to the jails’ largest union, as part of his plan with Molina to revamp the beleaguered city jail system.</p><p>“I told him what I wanted done and the conditions I want on Rikers Island, and all of the [DOC] facilities … and he is going to execute that plan,” Adams said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/adams-defends-firing-840.jpg><p>Union president Benny Boscio told The Post he had asked Molina to kick her to the curb because “she was killing morale.”</p><p>“We basically told the new commissioner what the problems were out of the gate that we saw morale-wise. He basically took our issues, the issues that we brought to him, and he made his own assessment,” Boscio said. “But we absolutely pushed for that.”</p><p>“She was not fair in negotiating with us when it came to discipline and we’re not sad to see her go,” Boscio added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/adams-defends-firing-835.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/adams-defends-firing-838.jpg><p>The former DOC head called the moves a “very disturbing sign.”</p><p>“Almost as if saying ‘We’ll make it easier to cheat and investigate you less,’” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vincent Schiraldi wrote on Twitter</a>, adding that “2500 out of 7700 uniformed staff were ‘sick’ on” New Year’s Eve.</p><p>“Form the beginning COBA pledged to fight that policy and we never stopped,” the union wrote to its members about the new sick policy that only requires a doctor’s visit after your third consecutive sick day.</p><p>Corrections officers have unlimited sick time under their contract.</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnlae2pHnAnZimq12ZsqexzZ2qZp6Zp7avs4yonWasn6V6qrrTnqmnmZxit6K1y6xknKegYq6nwMSrZK6mmaS7brzRnqqsraKafA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
