She says that she makes sure to stay consistent. "I wasn't the fastest or the strongest but after high school, I wanted to change and improve my health and body when I fell in love with wrestling. It took a lot of time and consistency to get to where I am today. I think too often people labor under the notion that either a person is athletic or they are not and there's no way to overcome that. But it's a myth."</span></p><p><span>When it comes to exercise, Bordeaux makes sure to workout her entire body. She tells Fitness Gurls that she dedicates a day to a different body part. "I work out at least four times a week focusing mostly on lower body and glutes for the majority of those days. I dedicate at least one day for upper body, so my legs have a chance to rest."</span></p><p><span>Bordeaux likes to do cardio to stay in shape. She tells Fitness Gurls that she opts for low impact exercises. "I also do fasted cardio a few days a week in the morning for 30 minutes," she says. "Usually just a power walk around the neighborhood." </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>The Mayo Clinic</span></a><span> states, </span><span>"Regular aerobic activity, such as walking, bicycling or swimming, can help you live longer and healthier. Need motivation? See how aerobic exercise affects your heart, lungs and blood flow. Then get moving and start reaping the rewards."</span></p><p><span>When it comes to wrestling, Bordeaux likes to be original. She tells </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>WrestlingSC.com</span></a><span>, "For the most part I don't try and copy anyone else. We all watch things we get inspired by. I love Maryse – I love her attitude, and she's beautiful, but I've never tried to mimic any other women."</span></p><p><span>When it comes to her career, Bordeaux is open to whatever."I feel that there are a lot of talented wrestlers and plenty of opportunities for anyone who's willing to put in the amount of effort and dedication it takes to succeed," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Wrestling Inc</span></a><span> in 2014. "Any of the companies who provide the amount of entertainment to provide quality shows that will attract a solid fan base will succeed. As far as my future, I'm constantly open to learning new things and staying challenged and focused. Whether it's as a wrestler, manager or ring announcer."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkrJuRp7mmwNNmmaiqlJqutsSMoqVmmpGptaq6xmaqrqGkYra0ecalprChnpx8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
