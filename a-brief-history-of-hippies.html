In the mid-1960s, a never before seen hippie counter-culture blossomed throughout the United States, inciting both the Flower Power movement as well as the general revulsion of more straight-laced, Ward Cleaver-esque Americans.
No longer wanting to keep up with the Joneses or confine themselves to white picket-fenced corrals of repressive and Puritanical sexual norms, these fresh-faced masses would soon come to be known as Hippies."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The most famous demonstrations were carried out by the Bread and Puppet Theatre Company, whose members crafted elaborate costumes for the rallies.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-10073 alt="Pentagon March" width=950 height=750 data-sizes="(max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/hippie-history-pentagon-march.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-10073 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Flickr</a></p><p>Perhaps one of the most poignant moments of the movement was on October 21st, 1967. 100,000 hippies, liberals and others marched peacefully on the Pentagon in an attempt to levitate it.</p><p>They were met with a human barricade of 2,500 soldiers surrounding the Pentagon. And soon enough, violence erupted when the more radical protestors clashed with US Marshals. The protest lasted for almost three days before order was restored.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-10072 alt=Hippies width=950 height=750 data-sizes="(max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/hippie-history-flower-gun.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-10072 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarah Luna Dear</a></p><p>To further promote their pacifist cause, some in the hippie movement placed flowers in the barrels of the soldiers’ guns while others made daisy chains. Clearly, the recent words of activist Abbie Hoffman remained in their consciousness. In a May Workshop in Nonviolence magazine, he wrote: “The cry of ‘Flower Power’ echoes through the land. We shall not wilt. Let a thousand flowers bloom.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-10076 alt="Pictures Of The Hippie Movement" width=950 height=750 data-sizes="(max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/hippie-history-sitting-down.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-10076 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Google</a></p><p>But by the mid-1970s, the hippie movement began to slow. After all, the United States was out of Vietnam, civil rights had at least formally been adopted in federal legislation, and, well, the yuppies had arrived. Young urban professionals who wanted to make a career for themselves began to occupy more national attention and thus the social libertarianism of the hippies took on a more symbolic role.</p><h2>More Videos About The Hippie Movement</h2><p>If you enjoyed this history of hippies, be sure to see our other posts on the <a href=#>most iconic photos of the 1960s</a> and <a href=#>life on hippie communes</a>.
