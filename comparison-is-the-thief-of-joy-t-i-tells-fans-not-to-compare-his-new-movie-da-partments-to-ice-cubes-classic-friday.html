T.I.’s 18-year-old son King reportedly is expected to have a role in the movie. King was not featured in the trailer, but he can be shown riding in a car in a flyer for the film. It highlights a group of individuals living at an apartment complex in Atlanta.</p><p>However, some critics are saying it looks like a 21st-century version of the NWA founder Ice Cube’s classic flick “Friday.</p><p>In a separate Instagram post, TIP shared a <a href=#>fan-made meme</a> that featured the question: “Y’ALL THINK T.I.

Cube, whose real name is O’Shea Jackson, followed up with three additional films, which did extremely well at the box office.</p><p>The first film “Friday” is a stoner comedy that takes place in South Central Los Angeles. It follows Cube’s unemployed character Craig Jones and his friend, Smokey, played by Chris Tucker, who deal with a number of issues that occurred on a Friday. It made $27,467,564 globally at the box office.</p><p>The 2002 release “Friday After Next” made $33,253,609 in its theatrical lifetime. But the movie that made the most in the franchise was 2000’s “Next Friday,” which racked up $57,328,603, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according</a> to Box Office Mojo.</p><p>Cube’s work both in front of and behind the screen has helped him achieve an estimated <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">net worth</a> of $160 million. He has producer credits on other films, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">including</a> “Ride Along,” Barbershop,” and the Oscar-nominated “Straight Outta Compton.” He also wrote and directed “The Players Club,” starring himself and <a href=#>LisaRaye McCoy</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, T.I.’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">net worth</a> is estimated at $20 million, with most of his earnings coming from his three-time Grammy-winning rap career.</p><p>Details about “Da Partments” are still under wraps. However, its ensemble cast also features Jayski, T.I.’s Grand Hustle Records artist Tokyo Jetz and many others.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX90e49vZmtrX5i8rrzAq6Csp55itrR506GcZqyYnrKnec6fZKOnqWLBbrWMrZylpKNis6K60malqKxdqbxur86mp5qqlWK1qr%2BMp5ywZZ2kw6qxjJ2YZqiRp8Gusc2tqmasn2K2pLGMnKybnaNisK2t0qygnGWWp7alrdho</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
