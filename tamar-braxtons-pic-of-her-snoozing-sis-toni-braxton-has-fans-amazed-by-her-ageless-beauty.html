My God she looks so young!”</p><p>“She looks no older than 15 here!! Wtf?!! She looks so young!! Good genes for real girllllll!!!”</p><p>“But why is she so beautiful when she sleeping….can I get the juice so I can look this young when I turn her age😩😍”</p><p>“Thought this was a teenager when I first glanced.

However, she did admit to a “nose procedure” to correct a lack of cartilage.</p><p>“I don’t have plastic surgery. I never had plastic surgery. I had a nose procedure done because I had to. I had no cartilage in my nose, I have a piece of cartilage from my ear put into my nose. I had a medical procedure done. I have no plastic in my nose,” <a href=# rel=noopener>she told</a> Ebony magazine in 2013.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX56e49sZmpsX6murq3RZpmrmaipvK%2B%2FjKmgnGWfm3qpsdFmqqenn6%2B2r7OMrKCsZaSku6p5wauYsayfo3qprdJmnZqmo2Kurq3Znptmmqlitaa%2BjJqenqSVqMBursSarK2xXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
