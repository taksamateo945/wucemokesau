This time around, our focus is on various aspects of Mariah’s physical attributes, including her height, weight, and body measurements.</p><h3><strong>Mariah Riddlesprigger’s Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>AGE:</strong> 31 Years Old</li><li><strong>BIRTHDAY:</strong> September 17, 1992</li><li><strong>BIRTHPLACE:</strong> Fresno, California, United States</li><li><strong>BIRTH SIGN:</strong> Virgo</li><li><strong>ETHNICITY:</strong> Mixed</li><li><strong>FATHER:</strong> Pat Riddlesprigger</li><li><strong>MOTHER:</strong> Cathy Riddlesprigger</li><li><strong>SIBLINGS:</strong> Makayla Riddlesprigger (sister), Maya Riddlesprigger (sister)</li><li><strong>HEIGHT IN INCHES:</strong> 5 feet 10 inches</li><li><strong>HEIGHT IN CENTIMETERS:</strong> 178 cm</li><li><strong>HEIGHT IN METERS:</strong> 1.78 m</li><li><strong>WEIGHT:</strong> 68 kg (150 lbs)</li><li><strong>BODY MEASUREMENTS IN INCHES:</strong> 38-30-40 (Breast-Waist-Hips)</li><li><strong>BODY MEASUREMENTS IN CENTIMETERS:</strong> 97-76-102 (Breast-Waist-Hips)</li><li><strong>EYE COLOR:</strong> Black</li><li><strong>HAIR COLOR:</strong> Dark Brown</li><li><strong>SHOE SIZE:</strong> 8 (US), 7 (UK)</li></ul><h2><strong>Mariah Riddlesprigger is&nbsp;5 Feet 10 Inches Tall</strong></h2><p>Mariah Riddlesprigger’s height is listed at 5 feet 10 inches (178 cm or 1.78 m). The 31-year-old is quite tall compared to the average American woman, who has a rather diminutive height of 5 feet 4 inches.</p><p>Riddlesprigger’s height is also almost an inch taller than the average American male, who stands at just over 5 feet 9 inches, while visibly dwarfing the average American woman by around 6 inches.</p><p>Mariah played volleyball during her high school and college years. As a member of the Rice Owls of Rice University under the stewardship of Coach Kieran Roblee, she played in the outside hitter position. She set some noteworthy records during her time in college, including ending her maiden season at the university as the highest scorer with 141 kills.</p><p>While Mariah might be significantly taller than the average American woman, nothing significantly separates her from a fellow female college volleyball player in the same outside hitter position who research has shown can be anywhere from 5 feet 8 inches to Mariah’s 5 feet 10 inches on average.</p><p>While it is a well-established fact that female college volleyball players can be as tall as 6 feet or more, Mariah is not far off at her official 5 feet 10 inches. She was considered an incredibly athletic hard worker. One would be hard-pressed to argue against the fact that her imposing height played a significant part in helping her achieve her goals of helping the Rice Owls achieve success during her time at the college.</p><h3><strong>Mariah Riddlesprigger is More Than 1 Foot Shorter Than Giannis Antetokounmpo</strong></h3><p>Mariah Riddlesprigger and Giannis Antetokounmpo became a couple in the mid-2010s. Though they are yet to officially tie the knot, the couple, who have been together for close to a decade now, have two sons, Liam Charles Antetokounmpo (born February 10, 2020) and Maverick Antetokounmpo (born August 18, 2021).</p><p>Mariah has shared and, in all probability, will continue to share a lot of milestones and similarities with the NBA power forward, but there is one aspect of their personalities where Mariah and Giannis are as different as night and day, and that is the very undisputed difference in their heights.</p><p>At 5 feet 10 inches, one would certainly argue the point that Mariah is a relatively tall woman. However, when stood next to her 6 feet 11 inches (211 cm or 2.11 m) tall boyfriend, Mariah’s height suddenly evaporates into the puff that is the over 1-foot height difference in favor of the insanely tall Giannis.</p><p>Given his occupation as a professional basketball player, those figures would probably not raise an eyebrow amongst his colleagues. Some in the NBA acknowledge the fact that height is not the most important attribute of a basketball player, but they have also settled in their minds that it certainly helps when you can easily get to the ream.</p><p>A basketball coach can coach a player on many things but how to be tall is not one of those things. What a basketball player does with his height advantage matters, and every indication points to the fact that Mariah Riddlesprigger’s boyfriend has figured out exactly how to maximize that advantage to the best of his ability.</p><p>Already an NBA champion and multiple-time MVP, Giannis Antetokounmpo’s speed, strength, and impressive skill set have set him apart from his peers, who all consider him to be one of the best players to have ever played in the NBA.</p><h2><strong>Mariah Riddlesprigger Weight Is Within the Ideal Weight Range For Her Height</strong></h2><p>Several sources have indicated that Mariah Riddlesprigger has a body weight of approximately 68 kg (150 lbs). Research has shown that the ideal weight for a 5 feet 10 inches female is between 61 kg (135 lbs) and 75 kg (165 lbs).</p><p>With those numbers in mind, it will not require a rocket scientist to realize that Mariah Riddlesprigger’s current weight figures place her in the mid-range of the ideal body weight of a woman as tall as she is.</p><p>While we have established the height-weight balance of the former volleyball player, it is also important to point out other aspects of Mariah’s physical appearance. Her shoe size of 8 (US) or 7 (UK) is just about right for a woman with her stature.</p><p>Her body measurement of 38-30-40 inches (97-76-102 centimeters), being measurements for her breasts, waist, and hips, respectively, indicates that she is a shapely woman with curves in the right places enough to entice a man like her boyfriend.</p><p>Mariah worked quite hard to achieve the ideal weight she now enjoys because having a child or children, as is the case of Mariah Riddlesprigger, can visibly impact a woman’s weight and how she feels about herself.</p><p>The celebrity girlfriend knows firsthand how self-conscious women who have just had children feel about their bodies. She has also dealt with the frustration that comes with not shedding the pregnancy weight fast enough.</p><p>Unlike some of those women, however, Mariah devised a plan to work on herself, and her plan included a strict exercise routine and a diet plan that included drinking lots of water. Despite the early disappointments and frustrations, she stuck to her plan, and suffice it to say that it has worked a treat.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLqivsian2aqmZmxrbHSqamin5eav7R5x56goKCkYravecWenK1lk6J6orrDZqSerJWnwHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
