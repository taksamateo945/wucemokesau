The plaintiff claims that as a consequence of the rapper’s order, she was shot in the foot by a stray bullet, causing her to fall and hurt her back.</p><p>As a result of her injuries, the woman lost her job at the Century 21 department store and also missed out on her chance to apply to the New York City Police Department Academy.</p><p>As it was previously reported, the 23-year-old was kidnapped and robbed on the 22nd of July, approximately six days after the purported shooting went down.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B96vrY6q-3M/</p><p>Tekashi 6ix9ine was easily one of the most talked-about cases last year when he ratted out his former gang associates to the federal government in exchange for shorter prison time.</p><p>In December, Tekashi was slapped with a 24-month sentence in jail, but much of the sentence had already been served due to staying behind bars during the trial.
