Captivating the audience with both old and new songs, Corook is a one to watch this year thanks to a stellar production, angelic voice, funky style and infectious new songs that are bound to dominate the charts upon their release.</p><p>Donning an iconic striped shirt, crocs, and a froggy bucket hat, Corook created such a welcoming atmosphere and safe space for people of all shapes, sizes, colors, and orientations.<span class=Apple-converted-space> Their</span> personality, stage presence, and overall vibe is something that we hope continues to draw more fans in as there’s something for everyone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/DSC_8997-scaled.jpg><p>To show the world a little more about Corook, we asked them if they’d be down to answer a questions after their incredible performance. Keep scrolling for our full Q&A and let us know if you love Corook by either leaving a reaction at the bottom of the post or by sliding into our DMs on Instagram at <a href=#>@celebsecrets</a>.</p><p>You can connect with Corook by giving them a follow on Instagram at <a href=#>@hicorook</a> and TikTok at <a href=#>@hicorook</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/DSC_9148-scaled.jpg><p><strong>Celeb Secrets: Being a sensitive person, what are some things you’ve learned or any advice you might give to someone who’s just as sensitive about dealing with mean people?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Corook</strong>: “I’m really in the thick of it so my advice comes from a place of still working through it. I’m currently working on letting the comments hurt me. I know that sounds backwards but it actually has helped me work through it easier. I have a much harder time trying to pretend it doesn’t affect me and then I hold onto it longer. This way I feel it hurt, say ouch, and then move on.”</p><p><strong>CS: Your government name is actually super cool, but how did you come up with the stage name Corook?</strong></p><p><strong>C</strong>: “Corook is a nickname that my girlfriend Olivia made up. We were slaphappy on a mega bus from New York to Boston at like 2AM and she called me corook skoovage.”</p><p><strong>CS: How many striped shirts do you own? Do you have a favorite one?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>C</strong>: “I feel like I have to have at least 20 striped shirts. But I do have a few favorites that I recycle quite a bit. My current number one fav is this blue, pink, green and white striped shirt that Lucy and Yak sent me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/DSC_9315-scaled.jpg><p><strong>CS: You’re such a talented songwriter, and so great with relating with your audience; is there a process to your songwriting, or is it just what you feel at the moment?</strong></p><p><strong>C</strong>: “My writing process varies a lot. Sometimes I have a big feeling and will play guitar or piano and sing to see what comes out. Sometimes I produce a fun track and start free styling over it. But I think the through line for my songwriting is always the story telling. My favorite songs don’t just ‘describe,’ they work through the mushy discomfort and land somewhere else.”</p><p><strong>CS: Since we’re Celeb Secrets, do you have any secrets from writing any of your songs that you wouldn’t mind sharing with us?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>C</strong>: “I wrote my song ‘Haircut’ around the time I was growing out part of my undercut. So I had the bottom shaved, the very top long and then between those two layers a strip of much shorter hair circling my head. We called it my 360 bangs. So when I sing “I have a haircut underneath my haircut” I mean it very literally.”</p><p><strong>CS: Okay, but if you did f***k with snakes, which one would you be most likely to give a chance to?</strong></p><p><strong>C</strong>: “A very tiny toothless one. If that exists.”</p><p><strong>LISTEN TO COROOK’S MUSIC HERE:</strong></p><p>With words and photos by Ashly Nicole.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="g1-beta g1-beta-2nd">What's Your Reaction?</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FEnKmerKNjsLC5jpymq6efoHqmucGrmJydo2K5sMLEZpinnF2eu6S41Kygr6Gkrnq4tdOhZJyZoKm2t63ToqWgZZyew6Z50qGmsGWRo7Futc2fnJysmaTCtHnSqKWgq12axaS41Kygr51f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
