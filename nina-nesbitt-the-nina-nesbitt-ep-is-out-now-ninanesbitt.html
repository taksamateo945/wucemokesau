Take a read at the Q&A below.</p><p>The Nina Nesbitt EP can be purchased on iTunes <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p><b>CS4U: The word “Selfie” was the most used in 2013, what inspired the song “Selfies”?</b></p><p><b></b><b>Nina: “</b>The song is a social commentary about a modern-day breakup. After you’ve been dumped, you start posting “selfies” about what an amazing time you’re having without that person. We’ve all done it! It’s a shameless song!”</p><p><b>CS4U: How did Ed Sheeran discover your talent?</b></p><p><strong>Nina</strong>: “He was playing at a small radio station in Edinburgh. My friend worked there, and I got to chatting to Ed and asked if he had any advice for upcoming singer/songwriters. He asked if I played guitar, and I said yes. So, he handed me his guitar and I played him a song. Then he invited me to come on tour!”</p><p><b>CS4U: How was your experience in Ed Sheeran’s video “Drunk”?</b></p><p><b>Nina</b>: “It was funny. It was the first music video I had ever appeared in outside of my own. There were lots of cats in it so that was cool.&nbsp;I love cats :)”</p><p><b>CS4U: You just released your EP “Nina Nesbitt”–can you tell us what we can expect from the record?</b></p><p><b>Nina</b>: “I picked 6 fan-favorite songs from my previous UK releases to create the EP to give the US an idea of what to expect from the album and me!”</p><p><b>CS4U: For our readers that haven’t heard of you yet, why do you think they should give Nina Nesbitt a listen?</b></p><p><b>Nina</b>: “I like to sing about current topics and real life. So hopefully they can relate to my songs. I’ve got a few breakup songs that people seem to emotionally connect to if they’re feeling a bit sensitive.”</p><p><b>CS4U: You were in Austin, TX for SXSW, what was your most memorable moment down there?</b></p><p><b>Nina: “</b>Well, the weather was much better than the UK. So, that’s nice! I got to speak to Debbie Harry (lead singer of Blondie) which was amazing because she’s my favorite. I also loved being able to see a lot of cool bands!”</p><p><b>CS4U: Since our website is called CelebSecrets4U, can you share one secret or hidden talent–something our fans would not know about you with us?</b></p><p><b>Nina: </b>“I named my UK tour after my pet & favorite meal! &nbsp;The Cats & Carbonara Tour!”</p><p>Photo: CrowdSurf</p><h2 class="g1-beta g1-beta-2nd">What's Your Reaction?</h2><span class=ppma-layout-prefix></span> <span class="ppma-category-group ppma-category-group-"><ul class=pp-multiple-authors-boxes-ul><li class="pp-multiple-authors-boxes-li author_index_0 author_celebsecrets4u has-avatar" readability=0.92266666666667><img data-del=avatar alt="Juliet Schroder" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/07/IMG_0935-96x96.jpg height=80 width=80 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="pp-author-boxes-description multiple-authors-description">Juliet is the founder and executive producer/host of Celeb Secrets and Celeb Secrets Country.
