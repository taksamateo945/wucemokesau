For more than a year, they had a long-distance romance and often traveled between their residences in Arizona and California to be together.</p><p>When Jodi Arias and Travis met and fell in love, she moved from her apartment in Mesa to be closer to him. There had been a declaration of abuse in their relationship before things went south, with Jodi Arias Bikini accusing Travis Alexander of it. While Jodi’s murder case was still in court, she made this accusation.</p><p>Because Travis Alexander had already died by the time this claim was made, Jodi Arias used it to plead “not guilty.” A 29-year-old motivational speaker, businessman and devoted Mormon, Travis Alexander, was Jodi Arias’ long-term partner.</p><p>During the murder, Alexander was stabbed 27 to 29 times and shot in the head with a revolver. Although Arias claimed self-defense, the jury found her guilty. In the United States, the murder and trial were widely publicized.</p><p>It was rejected on April 6, 2009, a request to review the defendant’s motion to remove the Maricopa County District Attorney from the case. A judge ordered Arias on May 18 to take IQ and competence tests. A defense petition in January 2011 outlined Arias’ lawyers’ attempts to get text messages and emails. When a judge ordered the prosecution to give over hundreds of Alexander’s texts to the defense, the prosecution originally claimed that no texts had been sent or received.&nbsp;</p><p>Esteban Flores, a Mesa police investigator, testified to the defense that Alexander’s emails were normal when they were given over to the security in June 2009. It was planned that Stephens would sentence Arias to life in prison without the chance of release or to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 25 years on April 7, 2015.</p><p>On April 13th, Stephens ruled that Arias should be imprisoned for the rest of his life without the chance of being released. Arias’ trials had already racked up a reported $3 million in legal fees on March 5, 2015. Arias’ lawyer Jennifer Willmott spoke about the social media uproar, the death threats she got, Arias’ sentencing words, the holdout juror, and her belief that Arias answered honestly in an <a href=#>interview</a> on April 8, 2015.</p><p>Arias was sentenced to pay over $32,000 to Alexander’s siblings in June 2015 during a reparations hearing. According to her <a href=#>lawyer</a>, this was just one-third of the sum she had sought. The Arizona Department of Corrections #281129, housed at the Arizona State Prison Complex – Perryville, will be the new home for Arias by 2021.
