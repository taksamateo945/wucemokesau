Dellenger noted that the Army-Navy game usually kicks off around 3 p.m. ET.</p><p>The 2024-25 season will mark the first year of the expanded 12-team College Football Playoff, bringing fans high-stakes games as early as Dec. 20.</p><p>The first round <a href=# rel=noopener>will begin on Dec. 20</a> at 8 p.m. ET with the remainder of the first round being played on Dec. 21 at 12 p.m., 4 p.m. and 8 p.m., respectively.</p><p>The quarterfinal begins 10 days later on Dec. 31 with the Fiesta Bowl at 7:30 p.m., followed by the Peach, Rose and Sugar Bowls on Jan. 1 at 1 p.m., 5 p.m. and 8:45 p.m., respectively. The CFP semifinal games, the Orange Bowl and Cotton Bowl, will commence on Jan. 9 at 7:30 p.m. and on Jan. 10 at 7:30 p.m.</p><p>Finally, the season will conclude with the national championship game on Jan. 20 at 7:30 p.m. ET.</p><p>With the expanded playoffs in place, the season will end a few weeks later than in past years. Last season, the national championship game between Michigan and Washington took place on Jan. 8, while this year's title game will be 12 days later than the 2023-24 season.</p><p>While the new CFP format is the main storyline this season, there are plenty of other fun bowl games to watch for. From the Duke's Mayo Bowl that ends with a coach being covered in mayonnaise to the Pop-Tarts Bowl that features an edible mascot, there's nothing quite like bowl season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmiFdYSMnKalpJWcsm6yzqirm5mcoXqju9alZKCZnZrAbn6Pa2tmamViwKS0xJ2spZ1dqMGivtNmq6Kllah6tcKMoqWfp12Wu6V5zKipnmWimrmmrdKemw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
