This set of three is referred to as the&nbsp;Forces of Nature&nbsp;Pokémon and have both base and&nbsp;Incarnate Formes. Tornadus is Flying-type while&nbsp;Thundurus is Flying-electric type, and&nbsp;Landorus is Flying-/Ground-Type.</p><p>To begin the hunt to add these Legendary&nbsp;Pokémon to the <a href=#>Pokémon Legends: Arceus Pokédex</a>, players will need to defeat&nbsp;Volo in the Temple of Sinnoh and return to Galaxy HQ. From there, players can interact with the NPC Cogita to receive the quest ‘Incarnate Forces of Hisui.’ For this quest,&nbsp;players will be given&nbsp;four clues indicating the locations of&nbsp;Landorus, Tornadus, Thundurus, and&nbsp;Enamorus. Of note, players will only be given the final clue for&nbsp;Enamorus after they successfully catch&nbsp;Landorus, Tornadus, and Thundurus.</p><p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag>SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Pokémon Legends: Arceus – How To Find (& Catch) Origin Forme Giratina</a></span></p><p>To catch Thundurus, players will need to travel to Cobalt Coastlands&nbsp;and search&nbsp;the&nbsp;large rocks in the water near Coastland Campsite.&nbsp;For Thundurus to spawn&nbsp;in this location, it must be during a rainstorm. Players will instantly recognize the large blue genie floating on a cloud with a distinct black spiked&nbsp;arm protruding from its back. Once players find this Legendary, Rock-type moves are some of the best <a href=#>moves to use in&nbsp;Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> against it, with Pokémon such as&nbsp;Golem&nbsp;with Rock-type moves like moves like&nbsp;Stone Axe or Rollout. If players need to change the weather, they can rest at a campsite to change the weather conditions until they get&nbsp;the heavy rain to spawn Thundurus.</p><h2>Finding&nbsp;Landorus and Tornadus in&nbsp;Pokémon Legends: Arceus</h2><figure class=item-img></figure><p>To find Landorus,&nbsp;players should travel to Obsidian Fieldlands during sunny weather. Next, players should head to&nbsp;Ramanas Island and search for Landorus. Players will be searching for a large orange genie floating on a cloud with a threatening black and red arm coming from his back. To explore the area faster, players may want to use a <a href=#>mount in&nbsp;Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a>. Once players find&nbsp;Landorus, the&nbsp;Pokémon may run from the player or instigate an attack. Players will need to dodge the attacks and try and get close enough to stun&nbsp;Landorus. Once stunned, players will be able to engage as normal and can attempt to catch him with Poké Balls. Ice-type&nbsp;Pokémon are an excellent counter for&nbsp;Landorus, such as&nbsp;Hisuian Avalugg or&nbsp;Walrein with Ice-type moves such as Ice Beam.</p><p>Deep in the Alabaster Islands at Bonechill Wastes during a blizzard, players will be able to find the third member of the Force of Nature trio, Tornadus. Like the other members of the trio, Tornadus is floating on a cloud and has a large green body with a purple and yellow arm protruding from his back. To&nbsp;<a href=#>catch this Pokémon in Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a>, players may want to include Electric-type&nbsp;Pokémon such as Jolteon or Luxray in their party with moves like Thunderbolt or Volt Tackle, which will be super effective against the Flying-Type. Of note, if players accidentally kill&nbsp;Tornadus while trying to make the catch, they can leave the area and return to respawn the Legendary.</p><p>Once players successfully catch the three Forces of Nature&nbsp;Landorus, Tornadus, and Thundurus, they can return to&nbsp;Cogita and receive the quest to catch and the newly-introduced&nbsp;Enamorus. This pink genie can be caught at the Scarlet Bog in the Crimson Mirelands. Once players catch&nbsp;Enamorus, they can speak with Cogita and receive&nbsp;the <a href=#>Reveal Glass in&nbsp;Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a>, which&nbsp;will allow players to change between the base and Incarnate Formes of the Legendary&nbsp;Pokémon.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Pokémon Legends: Arceus – Every Unlockable Outfit & Where To Find Them</a></span></p><p><strong>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</strong>&nbsp;is available for Nintendo Switch.</p><p><strong><span class=next-btn-text-title>90 Day Fiancé: Colt & Vanessa Reveal They Are Separated & Share Reason</span></strong></p><p><strong class=section-sub-title>About The Author</strong></p><strong class=bio-title><br>Ashley Edwards<br><span class=amount>(101 Articles Published)</span><br></strong><p>Ashley Edwards is a freelance writer for Screen Rant focusing on gaming guides and features.
