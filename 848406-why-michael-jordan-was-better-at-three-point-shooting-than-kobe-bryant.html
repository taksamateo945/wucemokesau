In Jordan's best 3-point shooting season, he shot over 42 percent and Bryant's best was at 38 percent."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He recorded the NBA's most amazing and famous 3-point shooting display of all time when he hit six threes before halftime in game one of the 1992 Finals.</p><p>In conclusion, yes Bryant shot 1.2 percent better in the regular season over Jordan for his career, but Bryant took so many that he will forever have a career shooting clip of 45 percent. All those 3s never won extra titles, and, in fact, he shot way worse in his finals series.</p><p>When it counted the most and the title was on the line (best time to shoot 3s if needed), Michael Jordan showed that any which way you look at it, he is the most flawless player of all time and an unmatched clutch master who indeed earned the title in every way of <strong>GOAT!!!</strong></p><p><strong>It is an undebatable fact that Jordan was better at 3s than Bryant. Shooting tons of 3s at 33.9 percent will never win games, but the 3 is a weapon, when chosen and used correctly, that can make all the difference in the world! Thanks for the memories MJ.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJob21wZGWDbsPHsmSmoZOdrqa4jKOmq5yRo3q4rdJmmZ6spJq%2Fbq3TZquhqpWaerG7yKerZquYpLy1tc2gZK2gkaN6rLvBnmSbqqmWu7U%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
