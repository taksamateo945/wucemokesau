He also has plans for an international tour across Latin America and Europe in the hope of inspiring other queer BIPOC artists. This track has quickly become his most-streamed single on Spotify, to date, and if their latest releases are anything to go by, nasir mf. is planning on making his mark on the electronic industry.</p><p>Clearly influenced by dance music as a whole, “romantic fury” sees nasir mf. delve into electronic synths and hyper-pop taking influences from the likes of Charli XCX and Caroline Polachek whilst adding his own stamp to it. The track features beats from Flame Yuppie, giving an unstoppable melody and an addicting rhythm with lyrical honesty and integrity. The accompanying music video, directed by Alp Topcu, has NYC-freestyle dance qualities, adding in a bit of vogueing to bring more dimension, creating a nostalgic ’80s and ’90s energy, as we watch nasir mf. perform in a boxing gym. Their passion for the song is clear in the visual as a whole and they showcase to the world that we all can serve art.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Watch the music video to “romantic fury” by nasir mf. here:</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Talking about the track, nasir mf. said: “This track is a hyper pop banger with rap verses for the electro-loving hopeless romantics. I made this track about experiencing limerence – that obsessive, unhealthy feeling that we often get for someone. I wanted to appeal to all the people who have someone who fucks with their mental state. It is super unhealthy, but hey, it happens… it is honest.”</p><p>“romantic fury”, by nasir mf., is available to download and stream, right now, across all platforms. Also, check out the ECHOVALLEY remix of the track, which extends the total duration of the track, adding 8-bit vibes throughout whilst mixing hype-pop with dream-pop, turning the track into a tranquilising fever dream that progresses into a huge bassline drop that the listener is never prepared for yet can’t help but love.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Let us know what you make of “romantic fury” by nasir mf. on Twitter <a href=#>@CelebMix</a>.</h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ksaq%2Fwqitnqpdo660tdFmpJ9lopq5pq3SnqpmmZ5isq2xwq2pqKaZmHqxu89mnLGonKTAqrvNZqafZZFiwKq6xqWcZpmemXquwdKimmaumZmysHnRqKSapqSesG6y1KuwaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
