Such defeat, however, did not keep the city from showing its team love. “We pulled up to the @atlhawks game to show and spread some love,” 2 Chainz told his Instagram fans. The rapper also shared pictures of him with his wife sitting court side at the game.</p><p>2 Chainz is a minority owner of the <a href=#>Atlanta Hawks</a> G-League team, which is better recognized as the College Park Skyhawks. The rapper spoke with <a href=# rel=noopener>Billboard</a> about his accomplishment in 2019.</p><p>“All I can think about is some of the job opportunities I can offer to the community by just being on the ground and being accessible,” the recording artist said of his minority stake in the team. 2 Chainz released an album titled Rap or Go to the League months before he was approached by Atlanta Hawks CEO Steve Koonin about having a potential stake in the Skyhawks.</p><p>“My album is called Rap or Go to the League, and then you look up and here I am a minority owner of a team that’s closely associated to the league — but I don’t think you can plan that,” Chainz said of the coincidence. “I think that’s all God,” the rapper added.</p><p>Steve Koonin certainly planned to offer the opportunity to <a href=#>2 Chainz</a> well in advance. “It dawned on us that if we’re going to represent in that area, wouldn’t it be great to have a partner who is from there, who goes back to that area and who has become big time,” Koonin shared with the press in reference to offering 2 Chainz a minority stake in the Skyhawks. “To have a pro sports team come into College Park and to have College Park’s son be a part of that, I think it’s a big deal for him, and it certainly is for us.”</p><p>Photo: 2 Chainz/Instagram</p><p><span class="post-views-icon dashicons dashicons-chart-bar"></span><br><span class=post-views-label>Post Views:</span><br><span class=post-views-count>122</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOa2ScoJGeu7t51qKdnmWRo7Fut8idqmaZpKmyr7CMmqulmZ6prm60wLCirGWXlrqmew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
