Federal prosecutors moved Monday to make Michael Avenatti’s seized $4.5 million jet an official piece of government property as part of his upcoming sentence in his client fraud case.
A forfeiture application filed in the Central District of California Monday afternoon said Avenatti tried to relinquish his interest in the Honda 420 aircraft last month in a separate forfeiture case but was unable to file a notice."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Boyle</strong> of the forfeiture unit in Los Angeles observes that Avenatti admitted in his guilty pleas that he’d embezzled $2.5 million from “Client 2” and transferred it to another law firm.</p><p>“As alleged in the Indictment, one such execution of this scheme was the embezzlement of funds from ‘Client 2,’ and specifically, that defendant “caused $2,500,000 of [Client 2’s] $2,750,000 settlement payment to be transferred to an attorney trust account for another law firm,” prosecutors wrote in their application. “That same day, defendant Avenatti caused Law Firm 1 to transfer the entire $2,500,000 to Honda Aircraft Company, LLC, to purchase a private airplane for defendant Avenatti’s company, Passport 420.”</p><p>As detailed in last summer’s trial, that law firm was the X-Law Group, which was controlled by Avenatti’s former law associate <strong>Filippo Marchino</strong>, and Marchino used the money to purchase the jet for Avenatti’s company Passport 420. Client 2 is <strong>Alexis Gardner</strong>, whom Avenatti represented in a mediation against her former boyfriend, professional basketball player <strong>Hassan Whiteside</strong>, and was one of five clients who testified against Avenatti.</p><p>His signed waiver states that he “expressly, freely and voluntarily forfeits all right, title, and interest” in the jet.</p><p>Avenatti, who is currently in <a href=#>prison</a> following convictions in <a href=#>two New York prosecutions</a>, is slated to be sentenced in the Central District of California later this year on Oct. 3 at 9 a.m. Pacific Time.</p><p>This is a developing story.</p><p>Read the full filing, below.</p><p>Have a tip we should know? <a href=#><span class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=2a5e435a596a464b5d4b444e495843474f04494547>[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX5uypb%2BMrZirn5Wpeq61wqGYnqRdlsOmusCtq6KrXZ%2BytXnIp2ScpJmau7V5xauYrpxdqLKvwMSnmp5n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
