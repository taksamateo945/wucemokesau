He’s teamed up with <a href=#>Axl Rose</a> and Slash of Guns N’ Roses, offering lively performances on the “Chinese Democracy” album. His efforts with <a href=#>Maynard James Keenan</a> and Billy Howerdel of A Perfect Circle on the critically praised album “Mer de Noms” received widespread recognition for its rhythmical sophistication. Freese collaborated with Mark Mothersbaugh and Gerald Casale on Devo’s “Something for Everybody” album, adding his own unique touch. His drumming skills were also demonstrated on Weezer’s “Raditude” album. He collaborated with the legendary artist <a href=#>Sting</a> on the 2003 album “Sacred Love.” His partnerships also extended into pop music, working with <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> on “Breakout” and <a href=#>Avril Lavigne</a> on her eponymous album.
