He will now sign a five-year contract with the Giants worth $150 million, including $87.5 million guaranteed.</p><p>Carolina will receive a 2024 second-round pick and a 2025 fifth-round pick.</p><p>The Panthers <a href=# rel=noopener>placed</a> the nonexclusive tag on Burns prior to the deadline, guaranteeing him $24 million for the 2024 season. The two sides had until mid-July to negotiate a long-term contract, but Carolina ultimately decided its best course was to trade him.</p><p>The 16th pick in the 2019 NFL draft, Burns quickly emerged as one of the top pass-rushers in the league. He was selected to the Pro Bowl in 2021 and 2022, posting a career-high 12.5 sacks in the latter.</p><p>ESPN's <a href=# rel=noopener>David Newton</a> noted that the Panthers had tried to sign Burns to an extension before talks broke down in September. Burns reportedly was seeking a contract with an average value of $30 million per year.</p><p>However, the 25-year-old saw a dip in production this past season, finishing with 50 total tackles and eight sacks. Still, Burns made it clear that he wanted to be paid among the top edge-rushers.</p><p>"Given our circumstances, it is what it is," Burns <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a> after the 2023 season. "But my feeling never changed from that point to now, because I put the work in four years prior to this."</p><p>After departing a Carolina team that finished with the worst record in the league at 2-15 last season, Burns should be excited to make his mark with the Giants. He will be a solid addition to a defensive front that includes Kayvon Thibodeaux and Dexter Lawrence II.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWeBdYOMp52lZaKqurC%2B0maZq6GRo3qjwdGnqmasopaxprCMraZmn5mWu7W%2FjJ%2BpqKVdpa6vwMeeqaxlnJa7pb%2BMbmSynZGnenKBj6ZknKeeqb%2Bir9M%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
