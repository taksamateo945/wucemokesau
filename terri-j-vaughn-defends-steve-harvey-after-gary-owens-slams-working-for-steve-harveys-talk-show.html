She played Lovita Alizay Jenkins-Robinson, the secretary at the high school featured in the series from 1997 to 2002. From season 2 until season 6, viewers watched Lovita date and later marry <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cedric The Entertaine</a>r’s character, Cedric Robinson.</p><p>Edwards asked her to weigh in on all of the controversy regarding her former boss and Cedric, noting that he had “heard recently” that she had issues with Harvey on set.</p><p>“Now somebody told me that and I’ve never said that,” Vaughn quickly clarified, adding a beat later, “He’s never done anything. Somebody said I didn’t like the way Steve talked to me on the set.

Additionally, she humorously recounted a conversation with Harvey regarding his expectations for women to always be impeccably groomed, despite his adherence to old-fashioned values, jesting that she could never be his “woman” due to these demands</p><p>“But that’s just Steve,” she said.</p><p>Vaughn’s defense of Harvey comes after two other comedians recently slammed him in the media.</p><p>White comedian Gary Owen, who often runs on the Black comic circuit, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">talked about working for Harvey</a> on his daytime talk show for three seasons.</p><p>“I just did ‘Hip Hop Squares,’ the show DeRay [Davis] used to host, and I filmed three episodes in one day on ‘Hip Hop Squares’ and made four times the money I made doing two weeks of ‘The Steve Harvey Show,’” the “Ride Along” actor said.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Gary Owen discusses the payment issues he faced while working with Steve Harvey and says the money he made from 'Hip Hop Squares' was four times higher than what he received while working with Steve Harvey.</p><p>(🎥 <a href=#>@garyowencomedy</a> ) <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/w8YdEd4qAs</a></p>— The Art Of Dialogue (@ArtOfDialogue_) <a href=#>January 8, 2024</a><p>He added, “It was only two people on the show every week, it was me and Steve.
