Butler became the smallest school to play for a National Championship since Jacksonville in 1970. Stevens became the second-youngest head coach to coach in the NCAA National Championship Game, behind Branch McCracken who led the Indiana Hoosiers to the 1940 National Championship at age 31. Stevens was named as both a Hugh Durham and Jim Phelan Award finalist for the third consecutive year, losing to Mike Young and Jamie Dixon respectively. He was also a finalist for the Skip Prosser Man of the Year Award, which was won by Bob Marlin.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$6 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Basketball Coach</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In the summer of 2000, Stevens was offered the opportunity to volunteer in the Butler basketball office. He ran the idea of quitting his job at Eli Lilly by then-longtime girlfriend Tracy Wilhelmy. She thought about it for two hours before telling him to go for it. “Now, it looks like a great idea,” Stevens later remarked. “At the time, I thought it was something I really wanted to try.” Tracy began law school to get a J.D. degree that could support the couple if things did not work out for Stevens. “We were 23 and realized this was our chance,” Tracy later said. “Five years down the road, we were probably not going to be in a position to do that. The more success you had at Lilly, the harder it would be to leave.”</p><p>Butler lost four starters after the 2007–08 season, and was picked to finish fifth in the Horizon league during the 2008–09 season. The team got off to a 12–1 start that won Stevens the Hugh Durham mid-season coaching award. On February 5, Stevens notched his 50th win as Butler beat Detroit 66–61. In so doing, Stevens became the sixth head coach in NCAA history to reach 50 wins in 56 games or fewer. Butler finished first in the Horizon League with a 15–3 in conference record, defying preseason expectations. Butler lost the Horizon League tournament final 57–54 to Cleveland State, but made the NCAA tournament as an at-large selection. The team received the nine seed in the South Regional, and lost to eighth-seeded Louisiana State in the first round by a score of 75–71 to finish the year at 26–6 overall.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Brad Stevens height</b> Not available right now.

Asked what his life would be like if he had never taken up coaching, he replies “If everything else remained the same, I would have been as happy as heck… Friends and family and faith, they’re going to take the cake over all this stuff.” Stevens met his wife, Tracy (née Wilhelmy), while attending DePauw University. Tracy, who played soccer for DePauw, quickly learned of Brad’s love for basketball; on their third date he drove her an hour and a half to attend a high school basketball game. Tracy graduated from Rocky River High School in 1995, and from DePauw in 1999. She returned to school in 2000, driving five hours from Case Western’s law school to Indianapolis on weekends to see Stevens. She finished her final year of law school in Indianapolis, and the couple married in August 2003. Tracy works as a labor and employment lawyer, and also serves as Stevens’ agent.</p><p align=justify>On April 2, 2007, Lickliter resigned in order to take the head-coaching position at the University of Iowa. The Butler players had a meeting with athletic director Barry Collier, urging him to promote from within. Collier, having spent the entire season observing the assistant coaches’ interaction with the team, agreed. The day after Lickliter resigned Stevens and Butler’s two other assistant coaches interviewed for the job. Within 24 hours of the interviews Stevens was named Butler’s new head coach. According to Collier, Stevens had something older, outside candidates could never match: six years of experience learning the Butler system, dubbed “The Butler Way” by Collier. “Age wasn’t a factor because I’d seen his ability shine through during the course of the season,” Collier said.</p><h2>Who is Brad Stevens Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Brad Stevens</strong> married to <strong>Tracy Wilhelmy Stevens</strong>.
