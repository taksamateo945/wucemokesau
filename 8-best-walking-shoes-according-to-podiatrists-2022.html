It’s known to be just as effective as running when it comes to longevity, and is far kinder to your joints than any sort of intense pavement pounding. But in order to get the most out of your walking workouts, it’s important that you’re wearing the right shoes whenever you set out to log those leisurely miles.</p><h2>Best walking shoes at a glance</h2><h2>How we chose the best walking shoes</h2><p>While most of us are likely repurposing our running or cross-training shoes for our daily walks, a good pair of walking shoes will make hitting your step count a far more comfortable endeavor. “Walking shoes are made for a rolling gait compared to running shoes which are made for more impact,” says Najwa Javed, DPM, a California-based podiatrist and creator of footwear brand E’MAR. “There is a greater need for cushioning and shock absorption in running shoes, whereas walking shoes have the need to be lighter and with more stability versus cushioning.”</p><p><span class="inline pr-6 text-seafoam-dark">Related Stories</span></p><p>“Walking shoes are sneakers that are more rigid (less flexible) and heavier than an optimal running shoe, but at the same time more supportive and stable than a casual sneaker,” says NYC Podiatrist Dr. Nelya Lobkova, DPM at Step Up Footcare. Finding that sweet spot in the middle may be tricky, but here are a few things to look for:</p><h3><strong>Rigid sole</strong></h3><p>Look for a walking shoe with a relatively rigid midsole (the part that touches the ground and determines which forces transfer between the foot and ground). The more rigid a sole, the more stable it is. “You should not be able to bend the sneaker in half easily or twist the sneaker easily when holding both ends of the sneaker. Thus a shoe that has a thicker midsole or rocker bottom is an ideal walking shoe,” says Lobkova.</p><h3><strong>Firm heel counter</strong></h3><p>Lobkova also recommends looking for shoes that have a firm heel counter, the back part of the heel surrounding the Achilles insertion. This allows the heel to sit in a neutral position in the sneaker and minimizes abnormal tilting of the rearfoot during walking.</p><h3><strong>Heel-to-toe drop</strong></h3><p>A heel-to-toe-drop is the difference in cushioning under your heels vs. under your toes. Lobkova says that the best walking sneakers have a 4-8mm heel-to-toe drop, which places less stress on the Achilles tendon and allows for more efficient transfer of energy through heel-lift and toe-off in the walking cycle. This is lower than the typical running shoes, which have a 10-13mm heel-to-toe drop, because the mechanics of walking do not require the heel to be as high during the contact phase of walking, compared to running. Shoes with a zero drop can leave the foot vulnerable to muscle and bone injuries when walking further than the corner coffee shop, she adds.</p><h3><strong>Materials and design</strong></h3><p>Depending on how long you’re walking, the surface, and the climate, you may want to look for different features.&nbsp; For example, walking on concrete vs. soil or sand requires different biomechanical support, so you’ll need more cushioning. And if you’re walking in warm weather, you’ll want to look for a shoe with a mesh or breathable upper, whereas if you’re walking in wet or cold weather, you might want to opt for a leather or Gore-Tex, weather-proof upper.</p><p>Ahead, find the best walking shoes money can buy so you’ll be stepping out in comfort and style.</p><h2 class="text-h2 wg-inline-shopable__title mb-[20px]">Best Walking Shoes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Brooks-Womens-Glycerin-18-Running-Shoes.jpg><p>Best for walking and running: Brooks Women’s Glycerin 18 Running Shoes — $150.00</p><p>Though these are technically running shoes, they offer the stability you need for all those daily walks.
