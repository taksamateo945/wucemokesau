In a December 2023 post, the former Miss Slovakia opted for video mode as she delivered a giant tease, but the brazen cleavage flash wasn’t the only way in which she was showing her confident streak.</p><p>In a sassy, amusing caption, Veronika reminded fans that she’s “hard to resist,” and it looks like her 6.8 million followers were loving it. Rajek may also have been delivering a play on words as she appeared to struggle to zip up her top. Perhaps, the zip wasn’t offering quite the right resistance.</p><h2>Bikini Queen Veronika Rajek Rocks Unzipped Top</h2><p>Scroll for the video. Filmed indoors and flaunting her jaw-dropping abs, Veronika posed in a girly, soft-cupped bra in pink, also peeping hints of matching, high-waisted briefs. Wearing a ribbed, ivory white crop top with long sleeves and a zip-up cardigan finish, the model completed her look with a low-rise, pleated miniskirt in denim, here giving a nod to her trend-setting daywear style.</p><h2>See More Photos Below!</h2><p>Thrilling her fans as she flaunted her eye-popping cleavage with that cardigan all unzipped, Veronika placed both hands to the zipper as she attempted to zip herself up, but it wasn’t happening too easily.</p><p>With her assets appearing to get in the way, Veronika made sure to match her facial expression to the situation, looking a little frustrated, but eventually making it. The Fashion Nova partner also kept glam with a blow-out as she showcased her blonde locks, completing her glam with matte makeup and making sure to showcase her Star of David Necklace.</p><p>“Hard to resist,” she wrote, also driving fans to her website via text in the video.</p><h2>Told She Is Hard To Resist!</h2><p>Fans were quick to spot the caption. “Yes you are!” one said. “Absolutely 💯 beautiful queen 😍,” another wrote. One fan even joked about wanting to be “as strong” as that zip. Rajek also gained over 270,000 likes for the post. She’s since upped the ante in more skimpy looks, including a plunging spandex one marking her Alo Yoga ambassador debut. In early 2024, Veronika expanded her portfolio of brand deals to include the activewear brand also fronted by model Kendall Jenner.</p><p>“Recovery is the silent warrior that strengthens and replenishes our inner body, the one essential in navigating the life’s journey. In 2024 I decided to hydrate more, and laugh often since it reduces stress,” she wrote on January 9.</p><h2>Talk About Confidence</h2><p>Veronika is confident in just about every way.</p><p>“I have a younger sister, who’s 18 already,” she has stated. “Honestly, I haven’t seen her for almost three years. We are totally different. I am the beautiful one. She’s beautiful, but the first kids are always (prettier). I don’t go back and visit Slovakia much.”</p><p>To see more of Veronika Rajek, follow The Blast on Facebook!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnnZaxqr%2FOp2SpnaSptrR50pqwrGWjnbK0eceaqZ1lpKR6s7HAnWSipl2hvLh5wq6rZqSZo7SmvsieZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
