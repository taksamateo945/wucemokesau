The pair met when he was just nine years old, and she was eight years old. Their relationship only grew stronger with time, with them eventually tieing the knot in 2017 in his hometown of Rosario.

If we look at his height throughout the years, it is clear that he was likely never going to grow beyond the average height for a male. This is because he<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> was diagnosed</a> with growth hormone disorder at a young age, which he was subsequently treated for. As a result, at 17 years old, he was 169 cm, and Messi's height at 19 was the same, making him the same height he is now. Some have also been wondering, how high can Messi jump? According to reports, as high as 41.1 inches, an impressive fete for any athlete, especially one of his size.</p><p class=align-left>In summary, the question of 'how tall is Messi' can be easily summed up as him being of average height for a male but shorter than many of his fellow football players.
