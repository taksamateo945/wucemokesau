They both might use patchwork pitching plans to get through Friday.</p><p>South Carolina used five pitchers in its 11-10 loss to LSU on Thursday night and it faces a quicker turnaround to 4 p.m. ET for its matchup with Kentucky.</p><p>The Gamecocks won the regular-season series with the Wildcats, but that was in a normally structured weekend.</p><p>Kentucky has had one reliever throw three or more innings in a single appearance in Hoover. That should help set up its pitching structure for the elimination game battle with South Carolina.</p><p>Although Kentucky lost the season series to South Carolina, it put up 15 runs in the game that it won on April 27. A similar performance at the plate is possible if the Gamecocks trot out some tired arms.</p><p>South Carolina scored 10 runs in two of its three SEC tournament games, so the opener in Hoover might be set for a ton of offensive fireworks.</p><p>The same can't be said about the second game since Mississippi State has been involved in three games with eight runs or fewer in Hoover.</p><p>The Bulldogs will likely go with an all-hands-on-deck pitching approach after they got at least five innings out of their three starters in the first three games.</p><p>Playing four games in four days is never an ideal situation, but Mississippi State is at least in a better spot than South Carolina to mix and match its arms because of how well the starters pitched.</p><p>The Bulldogs are going to need some standout performances on the mound to slow down Tennessee's offense.</p><p>The Volunteers scored 11 runs across two games in Hoover and they scored at least seven runs in four of their last six contests.</p><p>Tennessee's talent at the plate could shine through and take advantage of a Mississippi State team without its top starting arms available.</p><p>Friday's two winners move on to the semifinal round, where the tournament reverts back to single elimination. The two semifinal victors meet in Sunday's championship game.</p><p><b>Predictions</b></p><p>Kentucky over South Carolina</p><p>Tennessee over Mississippi State</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmeBc4CMrJycZZKWwKauwKWjZqyfqr%2Bvrcyepa1lYmV%2FdXnFq6CdmaliwKS0xJ2spZ1dlrulecGrmJyjlal6sb7EnaCcrJmku7Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
