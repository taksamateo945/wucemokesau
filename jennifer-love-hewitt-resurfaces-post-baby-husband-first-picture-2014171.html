Six weeks after giving birth to her first child, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Jennifer Love Hewitt</a></strong> looked happier than ever with her family — bundled-up daughter <strong>Autumn James Hallisay</strong> and husband <strong>Brian Hallisay</strong> — during a Wednesday, Jan. 15 outing in Santa Monica, Calif.</p>&nbsp;<p>Dressed casually in <a href=# data-link=1>sneakers</a> and jeans, the proud parents took a romantic walk along the beach with their newborn daughter safely tucked into her black Stokke stroller. "Jennifer and Brian are doing well with baby Autumn," a source tells&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Us Weekly</a></strong>. "They are both home with the baby and getting used to their new life together. They've had ups and downs dealing with a newborn: the sleepless nights and exhaustion, but overall they are loving their life as a family of three."</p><p>Hewitt, 34, looking comfortable Wednesday in an earthy, checkered cover-up coat, also debuted a short-and-sweet bob during the family stroll: The Client List star's trademark, long brunette tresses were chopped off past her shoulders and parted to the side. She wore minimal makeup as she beamed beside her hunky husband, 35, and doted on baby Autumn, who stayed cozy and unseen in her stroller.</p><p>"Jennifer has lost almost all of her baby weight already," the insider reveals to<strong> Us</strong>. "She has been going on walks and working out with her trainer at home."</p><p>Her husband, meanwhile, wearing a red hat with a chicken graphic, blue T-shirt and puffer vest, dutifully gave Hewitt a break at one point and pushed the stroller instead. Both mom and dad wore wedding bands on their left ring fingers. "Brian has really stepped up and is a very hands on dad," the source tells <strong>Us</strong>. "He helps out with everything and really takes on a lot of the responsibility."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Us Weekly</a></strong> exclusively revealed in late November, Hewitt had secretly married her husband just ahead of their daughter's birth — news her rep shared with <strong>Us </strong>after the couple welcomed Autumn James on Nov. 26.</p><p>The actress told <strong>Us</strong> last July that she was trying to stay stress-free through her pregnancy and motherhood: "I think most people, when they're getting ready to be a mom, they go, 'Oh my gosh, I have to have all of the answers right now,' but every kid is different, every parent is different and every child and parent relationship is different," she said.</p><p>"So you just sort of have to wait until you're in it and do the best that you can to try to be Zen in the middle of it all."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaKGepp6es6a%2BjKWmr51dnbK4tdOtZKudo6q%2Fp63CnqpmqJ%2BowW6uwJuwZqClqK%2BiusNmnaKqo6l6sbXCrayrnV1nfXKAkHBo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
